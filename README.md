Setup MySQL Database Backup and Email Notification:
This project aims to create a shell script to backup a MySQL database with authentication and send an email notification about the backup status using Python. Additionally, a crontab syntax will be created to schedule the shell script to run daily at 10:30 UTC.

Prerequisites
MySQL: Ensure MySQL is installed on your Linux system. You may need administrative privileges to install and configure MySQL.

Shell Scripting: Basic knowledge of shell scripting is required to create the backup script.

Python: Python programming language is used to send email notifications. Python should be installed on the system.

Crontab: Familiarity with crontab in Linux is necessary to schedule tasks at specific times.

Setup Steps

MySQL Database Setup:

Install and configure MySQL on your Linux system.
Create a MySQL database to be backed up. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access and backup the database.

Shell Script for Database Backup:

Create a shell script to automate the MySQL database backup process.
Use appropriate MySQL credentials (username, password, database name) in the script to authenticate and access the database.
Implement the backup process to dump the database contents into a backup file.
Check the backup process's status and handle any errors that may occur during the backup process.

Email Notification Setup:

Write a Python script to send email notifications about the backup status.
Use a local SMTP server to send emails.
Configure the sender and receiver email addresses, subject, and message body in the Python script.
Ensure that the necessary Python libraries for sending emails (such as smtplib and email.mime) are installed.

Crontab Configuration:

Create a crontab syntax to schedule the execution of the shell script at the desired time.
Set the cron job to run daily at 10:30 UTC.
Verify the crontab configuration to ensure it will execute the backup script as intended.
Example Crontab Syntax
bash
Copy code
# m h dom mon dow   command
30 10 * * * /path/to/backup_script.sh
This crontab syntax specifies that the backup script (backup_script.sh) will be executed daily at 10:30 UTC.

Conclusion
By following these steps, you can set up a system to automatically backup your MySQL database and receive email notifications about the backup status. Regular backups are essential for data security and integrity, and automated email notifications ensure you stay informed about the backup process's success or any issues that may arise.
